# üì¶ Inventory Management Web App (MERN Stack)

<br/>

## üöÄ Project Overview
This is a full-stack inventory management web application built using the MERN stack ‚Äî MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Designed to help users track and manage inventory with ease, the app supports adding new items, updating stock levels, and viewing item details through a clean and intuitive interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- HTML/Tailwind CSS
- React
- Redux
- MongoDb
- Mode, Express and Mongoose

<br/>

### üß† What I Learned
1. Full-Stack Architecture in Practice
- I gained hands-on experience in building a complete web app from scratch, integrating frontend and backend seamlessly.
- Learned how to structure a scalable codebase that separates concerns between client and server.
2. React for Dynamic UI
- Built a responsive and user-friendly interface using React.
- Mastered state management and component lifecycle to ensure smooth user interactions.
- Applied conditional rendering and form handling.
3. Express & Node.js for Backend Logic
- Developed RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations for inventory items.
- Implemented middleware for request validation and error handling.
- Strengthened my understanding of asynchronous operations and routing.
4. MongoDB for Data Persistence
- Designed flexible schemas to store inventory data efficiently.
- Used Mongoose for data modeling and validation.
- Learned how to handle database operations securely and optimize queries.
5. Authentication & Security
- Implemented basic user authentication and protected routes.
- Learned best practices for securing API endpoints and managing user sessions.
6. Performance & Optimization
- Explored techniques to reduce re-renders and improve data fetching.
- Practiced debugging and profiling to identify bottlenecks in both frontend and backend.
7. Deployment & DevOps
- Deployed the app using services like Render and connected it to a cloud-hosted MongoDB instance.
- Learned how to manage environment variables and configure build scripts.

## üå± Personal Growth
This project was more than just code ‚Äî it was a deep dive into the world of full-stack development. It challenged me to think holistically, solve real-world problems, and polish my skills across the stack. I now feel more confident in building production-ready applications and collaborating on larger projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### step 1: Clone the Frontend Repository and Install Dependencies
```
git clone https://github.com/smshiplu/inventory-manager-frontend-mern.git
cd inventory-manager-frontend-mern
npm install
```

### Step 2: Clone the Backend Repository and Install Dependency
```
git clone https://github.com/smshiplu/inventory-manager-backend-mern.git
cd inventory-manager-backend-mern
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the server directory and add the following:
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
REACT_APP_GUEST_LOGIN_EMAIL=shiplu@example.com 
REACT_APP_GUEST_LOGIN_PASSWORD=random
NODE_ENV=development
```


**NOTE:** Replace your_mongodb_connection_string and your_jwt_secret_key with your actual credentials to use it online

### Step 4: Run the App
```
# Start Backend Server
cd inventory-manager-backend-mern
npm run start

# Start Frontend
cd inventory-manager-frontend-mern
npm start
```

**NOTE:** The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend will run on `http://localhost:8000`.
